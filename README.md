# GAT4ncRNA
Predicting Functional Variants in Non-Coding RNA with Graph Attention Networks.

GAT4ncRNA is a deep learning-powered bioinformatics tool designed to predict critical functional variant sites in non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) from RNA sequences. Leveraging a hybrid architecture combining **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, this model dynamically captures long-range interactions between bases by modeling RNA as graph data with sequence adjacency and secondary structure relationships. It delivers high-accuracy, interpretable predictions for functional genomics and disease research.
